        <br />
        <p>
          I am a passionate full-stack software engineer based in NYC with a
          background in English Literature and Cybersecurity. 
          <br />
          < br/>
          I believe strongly
          in the process of security first when it comes to building platforms.
          I also love to learn and grow within organizations. Besides learning, my
          favorite hobbies include rock climbing, reading and cooking.
