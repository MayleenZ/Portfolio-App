        <h1>Thinking like a Programmer</h1>
        <br />
        <p>
          My introduction to programming began with the analogy of a sandwich. When making a sandwich, most of us can simply go to the kitchen and
          start without having to consciously think through each step. In
          contrast, a computer requires specific instructions such as going to
          the kitchen, taking three steps to the fridge, opening the fridge, and
          so on until a sandwhich is made. Understanding this process is a key
          aspect of thinking like a programmer. Shortly after this analogy, I
          wanted to learn more.
