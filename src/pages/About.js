      <h1>Thinking like a Programmer</h1>
      <h2>
        My journey as a software engineer began with a simple analogy of making
        a sandwich
      </h2>
      <p>
        As humans, we have developed mental shortcuts to speed up simple tasks
        from prior knowledge. For example, when making a sandwich, we can simply
        go to the kitchen and start without having to consciously think through
        each step. In contrast, computers require a step-by-step process to
        accomplish tasks. A computer requires specific instructions such as
        walking to the kitchen, taking three steps to the fridge, opening the
        fridge, and so on until a sandwhich is made. Undersanding this process
        is a key aspect of thinking like a programmer. Shortly after this
        analogy, I became intrigued.
